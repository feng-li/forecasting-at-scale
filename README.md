# Forecasting at Scale


## Setup the environment

- Make sure you have the recent version of Python (tested with version 3.12) on your system.

- Download the repository and unzip to a folder.

- Inside the folder, run the command inside your terminal:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

The script will:
   - Create a virtual environment `.venv` in the folder.
   - Install Jupyter and `ipykernel`.
   - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel.

This automates everything you need for your environment setup.

## To use it in Jupyter:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
   - Select **Kernel** > **Change Kernel** > **Python (forecasting)**
