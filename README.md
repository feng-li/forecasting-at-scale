# Forecasting at Scale


## **Setup the environment**

- Make sure you have the recent version of Python on your system
-  Run the script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

The script will:
   - Create a virtual environment `.venv`
   - Install Jupyter and `ipykernel`
   - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel

- To use it in Jupyter:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
   - Select **Kernel** > **Change Kernel** > **Python (.venv)**

This automates everything you need for your environment setup.
